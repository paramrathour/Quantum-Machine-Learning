% Though there are advancements in quantum computing technology, 
Nowadays, a general purpose quantum computer seems closer to reality than ever before, yet, it is so far. Can the near-term quantum technologies create an impact on ML and guide us towards quantum supremacy?
This report contains an introduction to machine learning and quatum mechanics. We also discuss a quantum algorithm to solve linear system of equations and then move onto discussing Quantum-Assisted Machine Learning, its the opportunities and challenges in the near-term future.

\section{Introduction}
Quantum Computing truly has the potential but, when will it live up to the (rising) expectations?
There has been a steady progress in this field, from increasing qubits to the increase in algorithms and design techniques. Popular quantum computing algorithms, e.g, Shor's algorithm, Grover's algorithm, Deutsch-Jozsa, BB84 Protocol, Quantum Fourier Transform and others have all been instrumental achievements in their fields. But in Machine Learning there is no such defining algorithm yet. Is their a feasible Quantum Approach for Machine Learning (ML) in near-term future? The estimated number of qubits in near-term future is 100-1000 which unfortunately is not sufficient for large ML tasks. We will focus on quantum approaches on a very promising field of unsupervised ML after getting comfortable with all the basics.

\section{Quantum-Assisted Helmholtz Machine (QAHM)}
A hybrid quantumâ€“classical ML which can potentilly handle real-world datasets. Its made of a  generator network and a recognition network using the notion of stochastic hidden variables. Classification can also be implemented in QAHM.
